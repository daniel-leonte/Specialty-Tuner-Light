# Minimalist Coding Practices

Follow these guidelines to keep the codebase simple, clear, and easy to understand, inspired by the minimalist philosophy of tinygrad (e.g., George Hotzâ€™s approach):

1. **Generate minimal and concise code changes:** Always prioritize simplicity. Avoid unnecessary complexity or features that do not directly contribute to the task at hand.

2. **Avoid emojis, excessive logging, and comments:** Do not use emojis in code or comments. Minimize logging and comments; include them only when absolutely necessary for clarity or debugging.

3. **Support incremental development:** Focus on small, focused changes rather than large-scale or full-project modifications. This ensures easier review and integration.

4. **Ensure readability and understandability:** Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use clear variable names, straightforward logic, and avoid overly complex structures.

5. **Prioritize clarity and maintainability:** When there is a trade-off between brevity and clarity, always choose clarity. This facilitates efficient review and continued development.

# Additional Notes
- These rules are designed to align with minimalist coding principles, ensuring the codebase remains simple and maintainable.
- The AI should always consider these guidelines when generating or modifying code.
